                <p class="mb-4">We are at a pivtol moment in history where Blockchain, 
                Cloud-Infrastructure and the Internet and IoT are actually making a difference in 
                both business and personal life operations.</p>
               
                <p  class="mb-4">We aim to build three base services with the intentions of later tokenizing the whole 
                company and going fully decentralized as a future DAO. Until then we will be focusing on building the brand
                making three seperate products and services that can actually change the world through IoT and blockchain.</p>

                <p  class="mb-4">The three product/services first focus on creating a base foundation for supporting web3 and helping businesses become smarter, faster, and more autonomous.</p> 
               
                <p  class="mb-4">Our team is made up of strategists, designers and developers. Innovators and problem solvers. 
                Small enough to be simple and quick, but big enough to deliver the scope you want at the pace you need.</p>
