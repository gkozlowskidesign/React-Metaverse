          MOT helps unify your web3 community or organization by 
        enabling better brand identity. We are doing this through using key componets of Scrum, and Agile Project Management which 
        major technology companies use today to be successful and productive. We aim to develop a PaaS 
        otherwise known as a Platform as a Service to help you learn about both Scrum and Agile so you can manage your brand 
        web3 business componets in a more organized fashion giving your organizations the mobility to create something unquie and
        identifiable.
